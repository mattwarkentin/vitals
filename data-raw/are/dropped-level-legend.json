{"title":"dropped-level-legend","input":"I'd like to make a ggplot that includes unused levels in the legend:\n\n```\ndf <- data.frame(x = 1:3,\n                 y = 1:3,\n                 z = factor(letters[1:3], levels = letters[1:4]))\n\nggplot(data = df) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y, color = z)) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\"))\n```\n\nThis produces a plot that's correct, where \"d\" is included in the values in the legend, except that I'd like to see a green dot next to \"d\" in the legend (instead of the blank spot next to \"d\") in the same way that other values have corresponding colored dots. How can I do that?","target":"Also add `show.legend = TRUE` to the `geom_point()` layer, like so:\n\n```\nggplot(data = df) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y, color = z), show.legend = TRUE) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\"))\n```","domain":"Data analysis","task":"New code","knowledge":"tidyverse","source":"https://forum.posit.co/t/scale-color-manual-with-drop-false-how-to-keep-icon/190265"}
