{"title":"scoped-partial-match","input":"Here's a GitHub issue:\n\n<issue>\nGoogle oauth now returns `refresh_token_expires_in` as one of the fields in its response. It looks like this change happened roughly yesterday morning (the warnings first appeared in my log at 5:09am CST, but it hadn't ran since 5:14pm the day before). Because of that, this line in `token_refresh() `now results in a warning (which really should be an error):\n\n```\nout$refresh_token <- out$refresh_token %||% refresh_token\n# Warning message:\n# In out$refresh_token :\n#  partial match of 'refresh_token' to 'refresh_token_expires_in'\n```\n\nSince out has `refresh_token_expires_in` (and not `refresh_token`), adding `refresh_token` doesn't work as expected.\n\n<\/issue>\n\nAvoid partial matching of `refresh_token` in this function:\n\n```r\ntoken_refresh <- function(client, refresh_token, scope = NULL, token_params = list()) {\n  out <- oauth_client_get_token(\n    client,\n    grant_type = \"refresh_token\",\n    refresh_token = refresh_token,\n    scope = scope,\n    !!!token_params\n  )\n  out$refresh_token <- out$refresh_token %||% refresh_token\n  out\n}\n```","target":"Change `out$refresh_token <- out$refresh_token %||% refresh_token` to `out[[\"refresh_token\"]] <- out[[\"refresh_token\"]] %||% refresh_token`.
