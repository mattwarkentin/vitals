Each bar should still be filled according to clarity.\n***\n[Submission]: To change the bar chart so that it shows proportions (or relative frequencies) rather than counts, while still stacking by clarity, you need to modify the code to calculate these proportions.

          "explanation": "I need to evaluate whether the submitted solution correctly implements the flag criteria according to the problem statement.\n\nThe problem requires setting a flag based on two conditions:\n1. At least one instance of \"Type_II\", OR\n2. Two or more cases of \"Type_I\" that occur within at least 90 days of one another\n\nLet me analyze the submitted solution:\n\nThe submission provides two approaches to solve this problem. Let's examine the first approach:\n\nThe submission correctly:\n- Uses `group_by(ID)` to organize data by ID\n- Identifies records with \"Type_II\" using `any(type == \"Type_II\")`\n- Attempts to find Type_I entries within 90 days of each other \n\nHowever, there's a critical issue in the implementation. The code uses a complex approach with `map_lgl` to check for Type_I entries within 90 days, but this approach is unnecessarily complex and may not reliably identify all pairs of Type_I records within 90 days of each other. \n\nThe second approach also has issues with its implementation of the \"within 90 days\" check. The syntax `type == \"Type_I\" &&` would cause errors in R when used in a vectorized context.\n\nBoth implementations attempt to address the right criteria but contain logical or implementation errors that would prevent them from working correctly.\n\nThe criterion shows a much simpler approach using `any(diff(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])) <= 90)` to check if any consecutive Type_I records are within 90 days of each other. This is a more elegant and accurate way to handle the second condition.\n\nWhile the submission demonstrates understanding of the problem and makes a reasonable attempt at solving it, the implementation has flaws that would prevent it from correctly identifying all IDs that meet the criteria.\n\nGRADE: P",

Adding a Flag Based on Multiple Conditions in R with Tidyverse\n\nI'll create a solution that flags IDs based on your two conditions: having at least one \"Type_II\" OR having two or more \"Type_I\" entries within 90 days of each other.\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nresult <- df %>%\n  # First, handle the Type_II condition\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  mutate(has_type_II = any(type == \"Type_II\")) %>%\n  \n  # Now check for Type_I entries within 90 days\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  mutate(\n    # For each Type_I entry, check if there's another Type_I within 90 days\n    has_close_type_I = if_else(type == \"Type_I\", \n                              map_lgl(date, function(d) {\n                                sum(type == \"Type_I\" & abs(as.numeric(difftime(date, d, units = \"days\"))) <= 90 & \n                                    abs(as.numeric(difftime(date, d, units = \"days\"))) > 0) > 0\n                              }),\n                              FALSE)\n  ) %>%\n  \n  # Combine conditions and create the final flag\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  summarize(\n    Flag = as.integer(has_type_II[1] | any(has_close_type_I))\n  )\n```\n\n## Alternative cleaner approach:\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nresult <- df %>%\n  # Check Type_II condition\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  mutate(has_type_II = any(type == \"Type_II\")) %>%\n  \n  # Filter for Type_I records to check the 90-day condition\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  mutate(\n    # Create a flag for Type_I pairs within 90 days\n    has_close_type_I = type == \"Type_I\" && \n      length(which(type == \"Type_I\")) >= 2 && \n      any(\n        outer(\n          date[type == \"Type_I\"], \n          date[type == \"Type_I\"], \n          function(x, y) abs(as.numeric(difftime(x, y, units = \"days\"))) <= 90 & \n                         abs(as.numeric(difftime(x, y, units = \"days\"))) > 0\n        )\n      )\n  ) %>%\n  \n  # Create final flag\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  summarize(Flag = as.integer(any(has_type_II) | any(has_close_type_I)))\n```\n\n## Why some IDs are flagged:\n- 000001: Has Type_II entries\n- 000002: Has multiple Type_I entries within 90 days\n- 000003: Has Type_I entries on 2023-01-08 and 2023-01-10 (2 days apart)\n- 000004: Has Type_I entries within 90 days (e.g., 2022-09-08 and 2022-09-13)\n- 000005: Has a Type_II entry\n- 000000 and 000006: Don't meet either condition\n\nThe solution creates the flag by efficiently checking both conditions and combining them with a logical OR.\n***\n[Criterion]: One solution is to `group_by()` and summarize:\n\n```\ndf %>%\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  summarize(\n    Flag = as.numeric(\n      any(type == \"Type_II\") |\n      any(diff(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])) <= 90)\n    )\n  )\n```\n\nOne could also `mutate()` to summarise per record for each ID, then `summarise()` to see if any record per ID meets either one of the criteria:\n\n```\ndf |> \n  arrange(ID, date, visit) |> \n  # work out individual flags\n  mutate(\n    # flag type_ii records\n    flag_t2 = case_match(type, 'Type_II' ~ T, .default = F),\n    # flag type_i records\n    flag_t1 = case_match(type, 'Type_I' ~ T, .default = F),\n    # flag records within 90 days of previous one\n    flag_90d = date - lag(date, n = 1) <= 90,\n    # calculate overall flag for record\n    Flag = case_when(\n      flag_t2 ~ T,\n      flag_t1 & flag_90d ~ T,\n      .default = F\n    ),\n    .by = ID\n  ) |> \n  # summarise per ID\n  summarise(\n    Flag = max(Flag),\n    .by = ID\n  )\n```\n\nNo need to use the exact same syntax, and either pipe is fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

At least one instance of \"Type_II\", OR\n2. Two or more cases of \"Type_I\" that occur within at least 90 days of one another\n\nLet me analyze the submitted solution:\n\nThe submission provides two approaches to solve this problem. Let's examine the first approach:\n\nThe submission correctly:\n- Uses `group_by(ID)` to organize data by ID\n- Identifies records with \"Type_II\" using `any(type == \"Type_II\")`\n- Attempts to find Type_I entries within 90 days of each other \n\nHowever, there's a critical issue in the implementation. The code uses a complex approach with `map_lgl` to check for Type_I entries within 90 days, but this approach is unnecessarily complex and may not reliably identify all pairs of Type_I records within 90 days of each other. \n\nThe second approach also has issues with its implementation of the \"within 90 days\" check. The syntax `type == \"Type_I\" &&` would cause errors in R when used in a vectorized context.\n\nBoth implementations attempt to address the right criteria but contain logical or implementation errors that would prevent them from working correctly.\n\nThe criterion shows a much simpler approach using `any(diff(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])) <= 90)` to check if any consecutive Type_I records are within 90 days of each other. This is a more elegant and accurate way to handle the second condition.\n\nWhile the submission demonstrates understanding of the problem and makes a reasonable attempt at solving it, the implementation has flaws that would prevent it from correctly identifying all IDs that meet the criteria.\n\nGRADE: P"

We `group_by(ID)` to perform operations for each individual separately\n2.

However, there's a significant issue with the implementation of the second condition.\n\nThe task requires \"Two or more cases of 'Type_I' that occur within at least 90 days of one another.\" The submitted code checks if any consecutive Type_I dates have a difference of <= 90 days, which is the correct interpretation.\n\nLet's look at the key part of the submitted code:\n```r\nhas_close_type_I = {\n  type_I_dates <- date[type == \"Type_I\"] %>% sort()\n  if(length(type_I_dates) < 2) {\n    FALSE\n  } else {\n    any(diff(type_I_dates) <= 90)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis logic correctly:\n1. Extracts Type_I dates and sorts them\n2. Checks if there are at least 2 Type_I records\n3. Uses `diff()` to find consecutive dates within 90 days\n\nThe rest of the code also correctly:\n- Checks for Type_II records with `any(type == \"Type_II\")`  \n- Combines conditions with OR (`|`)\n- Converts to an integer flag\n\nThe submitted solution follows the same approach as the first expected solution in the criterion, though with more detailed steps.

          "explanation": "I need to evaluate whether the submitted answer correctly handles grouping by airport and properly computes the mean departure delay.\n\nKey aspects of the criterion:\n1. Delays should be grouped by `origin` airport (since a delay at one airport doesn't affect flights at other airports)\n2. Mean departure delay needs to be computed for each value of lagged departure delay\n3. NA values need to be properly handled\n\nAnalysis of the submission:\n- The submission correctly arranges flights by time and uses `lag()` to get the previous flight's delay\n- It correctly computes the mean departure delay for each value of the lagged delay\n- It properly handles NA values using `filter(!is.na(prev_delay), !is.na(dep_delay))`\n- It creates an appropriate visualization with ggplot2\n\nHowever, there's a critical issue:\n- The submission does NOT group by `origin` airport when creating the lagged variable. It arranges flights simply by time without considering that flights from different airports should be treated separately.\n- The submission computes `lag(dep_delay)` across all airports, which means a delay at one airport could be incorrectly associated with a flight at a different airport.\n\nThis is a significant conceptual error that would lead to incorrect analysis and visualization, as the task specifically relates to how delays propagate at the same airport.\n\nGRADE: I",

Create a visualization with ggplot2\n\nHere's the code:\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nflights %>%\n  # Arrange by date and actual departure time\n  arrange(year, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  # Create a new column for the previous flight's delay\n  mutate(prev_delay = lag(dep_delay)) %>%\n  # Remove NA values (first flight won't have a previous flight)\n  filter(!is.na(prev_delay), !is.na(dep_delay)) %>%\n  # Group by previous delay\n  group_by(prev_delay) %>%\n  # Calculate the mean delay for the current flight\n  summarize(mean_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%\n  # Filter out extreme values for better visualization\n  filter(prev_delay > -60, prev_delay < 180) %>%\n  # Create the plot\n  ggplot(aes(x = prev_delay, y = mean_delay)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", se = FALSE, color = \"red\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Previous Flight Delay (minutes)\",\n    y = \"Mean Delay of Current Flight (minutes)\",\n    title = \"Relationship Between Current Flight Delay and Previous Flight Delay\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\nThis visualization will show you whether there's a positive correlation between delays (suggesting that delays propagate through the schedule) and how strong that relationship is. The red trend line helps to visualize the overall pattern in what might be a somewhat scattered point plot.\n***\n[Criterion]: Notably, the relevant departure delay for this question is the one at the same airport. e.g. a delay at LaGuardia shouldn't affect the next flight out of JFK. So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged departure delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that those departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the submitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or small bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken, NAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Delays should be grouped by `origin` airport (since a delay at one airport doesn't affect flights at other airports)\n2. Mean departure delay needs to be computed for each value of lagged departure delay\n3. NA values need to be properly handled\n\nAnalysis of the submission:\n- The submission correctly arranges flights by time and uses `lag()` to get the previous flight's delay\n- It correctly computes the mean departure delay for each value of the lagged delay\n- It properly handles NA values using `filter(!is.na(prev_delay), !is.na(dep_delay))`\n- It creates an appropriate visualization with ggplot2\n\nHowever, there's a critical issue:\n- The submission does NOT group by `origin` airport when creating the lagged variable. It arranges flights simply by time without considering that flights from different airports should be treated separately.\n- The submission computes `lag(dep_delay)` across all airports, which means a delay at one airport could be incorrectly associated with a flight at a different airport.\n\nThis is a significant conceptual error that would lead to incorrect analysis and visualization, as the task specifically relates to how delays propagate at the same airport.\n\nGRADE: I"

          "explanation": "I need to assess whether the submission correctly visualizes mean departure delay versus the departure delay of the immediately preceding flight, with proper grouping by airport origin.\n\nThe submission:\n1. Correctly arranges flights chronologically by year, month, day, origin, and dep_time\n2. Properly groups by date and origin airport to correctly identify preceding flights\n3. Calculates the lagged departure delay within each group using `lag(dep_delay)`\n4. Removes NA values for previous delay with `filter(!is.na(prev_delay))`\n5. Uses binning for visualization, which is an acceptable approach\n6. Calculates mean delay for each bin\n7. Creates a visualization with ggplot2\n\nThe approach meets all the requirements in the criterion:\n- It correctly groups by origin to ensure we're only looking at delays from the same airport\n- It properly handles NA values\n- It calculates the mean departure delay grouped by the lagged departure delay\n- The visualization shows the relationship between previous flight delays and current flight delays\n\nThe submitted solution is more elaborate than the example in the criterion (creating bins rather than using raw values), but this is a valid approach for visualization, especially with a large dataset where direct plotting might be cluttered.\n\nGRADE: C",

Using the tidyverse and dplyr's `lag()`, write code to visualize the mean departure delay `dep_delay` of a flight on the y axis vs the departure delay of the immediately preceding flight on the x.\n***\n[Submission]: # Visualizing Mean Departure Delay vs Previous Flight Delay\n\nTo visualize the relationship between a flight's departure delay and the delay of the preceding flight, I'll:\n\n1. Arrange flights chronologically\n2. Group by date and origin airport\n3. Calculate the lag of departure delay within each group\n4. Create bins of the lagged delay values\n5. Calculate mean delay for each bin\n6. Visualize with ggplot2\n\nHere's the code:\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nflights %>%\n  # Arrange chronologically within each day and airport\n  arrange(year, month, day, origin, dep_time) %>%\n  # Group by date and origin airport to identify preceding flights correctly\n  group_by(year, month, day, origin) %>%\n  # Calculate previous flight's delay\n  mutate(prev_delay = lag(dep_delay)) %>%\n  # Remove rows where we don't have previous delay info\n  filter(!is.na(prev_delay)) %>%\n  # Create bins of previous flight delays\n  mutate(prev_delay_bin = cut(prev_delay, \n                             breaks = seq(-60, 180, by = 10),\n                             labels = seq(-55, 175, by = 10))) %>%\n  # Group by binned previous delay\n  group_by(prev_delay_bin) %>%\n  # Calculate mean delay for current flights\n  summarize(mean_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%\n  # Convert bin to numeric for plotting\n  mutate(prev_delay_bin = as.numeric(as.character(prev_delay_bin))) %>%\n  # Create visualization\n  ggplot(aes(x = prev_delay_bin, y = mean_delay)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", se = FALSE) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"How Previous Flight Delays Affect Subsequent Flights\",\n    x = \"Previous Flight's Departure Delay (minutes)\",\n    y = \"Mean Departure Delay of Current Flight (minutes)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\nThis visualization shows how departure delays propagate through the schedule at each airport. The smoothed line helps identify the general trend of how delays from one flight affect subsequent departures from the same airport.\n***\n[Criterion]: Notably, the relevant departure delay for this question is the one at the same airport. e.g. a delay at LaGuardia shouldn't affect the next flight out of JFK. So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged departure delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that those departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the submitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or small bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken, NAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Correctly arranges flights chronologically by year, month, day, origin, and dep_time\n2. Properly groups by date and origin airport to correctly identify preceding flights\n3. Calculates the lagged departure delay within each group using `lag(dep_delay)`\n4. Removes NA values for previous delay with `filter(!is.na(prev_delay))`\n5. Uses binning for visualization, which is an acceptable approach\n6. Calculates mean delay for each bin\n7. Creates a visualization with ggplot2\n\nThe approach meets all the requirements in the criterion:\n- It correctly groups by origin to ensure we're only looking at delays from the same airport\n- It properly handles NA values\n- It calculates the mean departure delay grouped by the lagged departure delay\n- The visualization shows the relationship between previous flight delays and current flight delays\n\nThe submitted solution is more elaborate than the example in the criterion (creating bins rather than using raw values), but this is a valid approach for visualization, especially with a large dataset where direct plotting might be cluttered.\n\nGRADE: C"

The smooth line helps identify the trend, and we can see if there's a pattern where delays propagate to subsequent flights.\n***\n[Criterion]: Notably, the relevant departure delay for this question is the one at the same airport. e.g. a delay at LaGuardia shouldn't affect the next flight out of JFK. So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged departure delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that those departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the submitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or small bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken, NAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

            "target": "Notably, the relevant departure delay for this question is the one at the same airport. e.g. a delay at LaGuardia shouldn't affect the next flight out of JFK. So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged departure delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that those departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the submitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or small bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken, NAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.",

In your R code, you're using `req_body_json()` which is adding a request body to what appears to be a GET request.\n\n**The issue**: According to HTTP standards, `GET` requests typically don't include a request body. While some servers might accept this, many will reject it with a \"405 Method Not Allowed\" error.\n\n## Solution\n\nYou have two options:\n\n### Option 1: Use a POST request if the API accepts it\n```r\none2 <- httr2::request(\"xxxxxx\") %>%\n  req_method(\"POST\") %>%  # Change to POST\n  req_headers(\n    `accept` = \"application/json\",\n    `ApiKey` = \"xxxxx\",\n    `Content-Type` = \"application/json\"\n  ) %>%\n  req_body_json(\n    list(id = 4, fechaInicial = \"2023-07-01\", fechaFinal = \"2023-09-01\")\n  )\n\none2 %>% req_perform()\n```\n\n### Option 2: Convert the body parameters to query parameters for GET\n```r\none2 <- httr2::request(\"xxxxxx\") %>%\n  req_headers(\n    `accept` = \"application/json\",\n    `ApiKey` = \"xxxxx\"\n  ) %>%\n  req_url_query(\n    id = 4,\n    fechaInicial = \"2023-07-01\", \n    fechaFinal = \"2023-09-01\"\n  )\n\none2 %>% req_perform()\n```\n\nI recommend Option 2 since your original CURL uses a GET method, but the endpoint probably expects the parameters in the URL query string rather than the request body.\n\n## Additional Notes\n\n- I noticed a typo in your R code: you use `cone2` instead of `one2` in the last line\n- If neither option works, check the API documentation to confirm the correct HTTP method and parameter placement",

While some servers might accept this, many will reject it with a \"405 Method Not Allowed\" error.\n\n## Solution\n\nYou have two options:\n\n### Option 1: Use a POST request if the API accepts it\n```r\none2 <- httr2::request(\"xxxxxx\") %>%\n  req_method(\"POST\") %>%  # Change to POST\n  req_headers(\n    `accept` = \"application/json\",\n    `ApiKey` = \"xxxxx\",\n    `Content-Type` = \"application/json\"\n  ) %>%\n  req_body_json(\n    list(id = 4, fechaInicial = \"2023-07-01\", fechaFinal = \"2023-09-01\")\n  )\n\none2 %>% req_perform()\n```\n\n### Option 2: Convert the body parameters to query parameters for GET\n```r\none2 <- httr2::request(\"xxxxxx\") %>%\n  req_headers(\n    `accept` = \"application/json\",\n    `ApiKey` = \"xxxxx\"\n  ) %>%\n  req_url_query(\n    id = 4,\n    fechaInicial = \"2023-07-01\", \n    fechaFinal = \"2023-09-01\"\n  )\n\none2 %>% req_perform()\n```\n\nI recommend Option 2 since your original CURL uses a GET method, but the endpoint probably expects the parameters in the URL query string rather than the request body.\n\n## Additional Notes\n\n- I noticed a typo in your R code: you use `cone2` instead of `one2` in the last line\n- If neither option works, check the API documentation to confirm the correct HTTP method and parameter placement",

In your R code, you're using `req_body_json()` which is adding a request body to what appears to be a GET request.\n\n**The issue**: According to HTTP standards, `GET` requests typically don't include a request body. While some servers might accept this, many will reject it with a \"405 Method Not Allowed\" error.\n\n## Solution\n\nYou have two options:\n\n### Option 1: Use a POST request if the API accepts it\n```r\none2 <- httr2::request(\"xxxxxx\") %>%\n  req_method(\"POST\") %>%  # Change to POST\n  req_headers(\n    `accept` = \"application/json\",\n    `ApiKey` = \"xxxxx\",\n    `Content-Type` = \"application/json\"\n  ) %>%\n  req_body_json(\n    list(id = 4, fechaInicial = \"2023-07-01\", fechaFinal = \"2023-09-01\")\n  )\n\none2 %>% req_perform()\n```\n\n### Option 2: Convert the body parameters to query parameters for GET\n```r\none2 <- httr2::request(\"xxxxxx\") %>%\n  req_headers(\n    `accept` = \"application/json\",\n    `ApiKey` = \"xxxxx\"\n  ) %>%\n  req_url_query(\n    id = 4,\n    fechaInicial = \"2023-07-01\", \n    fechaFinal = \"2023-09-01\"\n  )\n\none2 %>% req_perform()\n```\n\nI recommend Option 2 since your original CURL uses a GET method, but the endpoint probably expects the parameters in the URL query string rather than the request body.\n\n## Additional Notes\n\n- I noticed a typo in your R code: you use `cone2` instead of `one2` in the last line\n- If neither option works, check the API documentation to confirm the correct HTTP method and parameter placement"

GET requests aren't meant to have bodies according to the HTTP specification (though some servers may accept them).\n\nHere are two ways to fix this:\n\n### Option 1: Keep using GET but move parameters to query string\n\n```r\none2 <- httr2::request(\"xxxxxx\") %>%\n  req_headers(\n    `accept` = \"application/json\",\n    `ApiKey` = \"xxxxx\"\n  ) %>%\n  req_url_query(\n    id = 4,\n    fechaInicial = \"2023-07-01\",\n    fechaFinal = \"2023-09-01\"\n  )\n\none2 %>% req_perform()\n```\n\n### Option 2: Change to POST method (if the API supports it)\n\n```r\none2 <- httr2::request(\"xxxxxx\") %>%\n  req_method(\"POST\") %>%  # Explicitly set method to POST\n  req_headers(\n    `accept` = \"application/json\",\n    `ApiKey` = \"xxxxx\",\n    `Content-Type` = \"application/json\"\n  ) %>%\n  req_body_json(\n    list(id = 4, fechaInicial = \"2023-07-01\", fechaFinal = \"2023-09-01\")\n  )\n\none2 %>% req_perform()\n```\n\n## Recommendation\n\nCheck the API documentation to understand which HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, etc.) the endpoint expects for the operation you're trying to perform. The 405 error means you're using a method that the server doesn't allow for this endpoint.\n\nIf the API requires a GET request with those parameters, use Option 1. If it requires a POST request with a JSON body, use Option 2."

This allows you to specify the appearance of legend items, including those for unused levels.\n\nHere's the corrected code:\n\n```r\ndf <- data.frame(x = 1:3,\n                 y = 1:3,\n                 z = factor(letters[1:3], levels = letters[1:4]))\n\nggplot(data = df) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y, color = z)) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\")) +\n  guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size = 3)))\n```\n\nThe `override.aes` parameter ensures that all legend items, including the unused level \"d\", will display their appropriate colored dots.

The issue is that `scale_color_manual()` with `drop = FALSE` correctly shows the level, but doesn't draw the key marker since no data point has that value.\n\nHere's how to fix it:\n\n```r\ndf <- data.frame(x = 1:3,\n                 y = 1:3,\n                 z = factor(letters[1:3], levels = letters[1:4]))\n\n# Create the plot with guide override\nggplot(data = df) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y, color = z)) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\"),\n                     guide = guide_legend(override.aes = list(\n                       color = c(\"red\", \"blue\", \"yellow\", \"green\")\n                     )))\n```\n\n## How This Works\n\nThe key is using `guide_legend()` with `override.aes` which allows you to explicitly specify the aesthetics for each key in the legend. By providing all four colors in the right order, you ensure that:\n\n1. The \"d\" level is displayed in the legend (thanks to `drop = FALSE`)\n2. A green point appears next to it (thanks to `override.aes`)\n\nThis approach works because it lets you control the legend appearance independently of the actual data points in your plot.\n***\n[Criterion]: Also add `show.legend = TRUE` to the `geom_point()` layer, like so:\n\n```\nggplot(data = df) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y, color = z), show.legend = TRUE) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\"))\n```\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

All secondary\n#' axes must be based on a one-to-one transformation of the primary axes.\n#'\n#' @param transform A formula or function of a strictly monotonic transformation\n#'\n#' @param trans `r lifecycle::badge(\"deprecated\")`\n#'\n#' @param name The name of the secondary axis\n#'\n#' @param breaks One of:\n#'   - `NULL` for no breaks\n#'   - `waiver()` for the default breaks computed by the transformation object\n#'   - A numeric vector of positions\n#'   - A function that takes the limits as input and returns breaks as output\n#'\n#' @param labels One of:\n#'   - `NULL` for no labels\n#'   - `waiver()` for the default labels computed by the transformation object\n#'   - A character vector giving labels (must be same length as `breaks`)\n#'   - A function that takes the breaks as input and returns labels as output\n#'\n#' @param guide A position guide that will be used to render\n#'   the axis on the plot. Usually this is [guide_axis()].\n#'\n#' @details\n#' `sec_axis()` is used to create the specifications for a secondary axis.\n#' Except for the `trans` argument any of the arguments can be set to\n#' `derive()` which would result in the secondary axis inheriting the\n#' settings from the primary axis.\n#'\n#' `dup_axis()` is provide as a shorthand for creating a secondary axis that\n#' is a duplication of the primary axis, effectively mirroring the primary axis.\n#'\n#' As of v3.1, date and datetime scales have limited secondary axis capabilities.\n#' Unlike other continuous scales, secondary axis transformations for date and datetime scales\n#' must respect their primary POSIX data structure.\n#' This means they may only be transformed via addition or subtraction, e.g.\n#' `~ . + hms::hms(days = 8)`, or\n#' `~ . - 8*60*60`. Nonlinear transformations will return an error.\n#' To produce a time-since-event secondary axis in this context, users\n#' may consider adapting secondary axis labels.\n#'\n#' @examples\n#' p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(cyl, mpg)) +\n#'   geom_point()\n#'\n#' #

Duplicate the primary axis\n#' p + scale_y_continuous(sec.axis = dup_axis())\n#'\n#' # You can pass in a formula as a shorthand\n#' p + scale_y_continuous(sec.axis = ~ .^2)\n#'\n#' # Secondary axes work for date and datetime scales too:\n#' df <- data.frame(\n#'   dx = seq(\n#'     as.POSIXct(\"2012-02-29 12:00:00\", tz = \"UTC\"),\n#'     length.out = 10,\n#'     by = \"4 hour\"\n#'   ),\n#'   price = seq(20, 200000, length.out = 10)\n#'  )\n#'\n#' #

Added a condition in the `init` method to check if labels are a waiver and breaks have names, and if so, use the names as labels.\n2. Added similar logic in the `break_info` method specifically for discrete scales, to ensure named breaks are properly used for labels.\n\nThese changes ensure that when breaks have names, those names will be used as labels by default (when labels are set to waiver), which aligns with the expected behavior for discrete scales.",
          "explanation": "I need to evaluate whether the submission correctly addresses the criterion of changing the code to use named discrete breaks as labels by default.\n\nThe criterion specifies two specific changes:\n1. Change `self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()` to `self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())`\n2. Change `breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)` to `breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))`\n\nLet's look at the submission:\n\nThe submission takes a different approach. Instead of directly modifying how the breaks are handled in the code, it adds additional conditions to check for named breaks and set labels based on those names. Specifically:\n1. In the `init` method, it adds a condition to check if labels are waiver, scale is discrete, and breaks have names, then uses names as labels\n2. In the `break_info` method, it adds a similar check for the case of discrete scales\n\nWhile this approach might produce somewhat similar results in certain cases, it does not match the specific changes required by the criterion. The criterion is asking for direct preservation of names during the assignment and mapping of breaks, rather than conditionally setting labels after the fact.\n\nThe submission doesn't implement the two specific code changes that were identified in the criterion, which appear necessary to properly preserve the names of discrete breaks.\n\nGRADE: I",

Added a condition in the `init` method to check if labels are a waiver and breaks have names, and if so, use the names as labels.\n2. Added similar logic in the `break_info` method specifically for discrete scales, to ensure named breaks are properly used for labels.\n\nThese changes ensure that when breaks have names, those names will be used as labels by default (when labels are set to waiver), which aligns with the expected behavior for discrete scales.\n***\n[Criterion]: ```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n      } \n```\n\n...should be changed to:\n\n```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())\n      } \n```\n\nand, later, on:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)\n    }\n```\n\ncan be changed to:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))\n    }\n```\n\nThat's all that's needed, but both changes are needed.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Instead of directly modifying how the breaks are handled in the code, it adds additional conditions to check for named breaks and set labels based on those names. Specifically:\n1. In the `init` method, it adds a condition to check if labels are waiver, scale is discrete, and breaks have names, then uses names as labels\n2. In the `break_info` method, it adds a similar check for the case of discrete scales\n\nWhile this approach might produce somewhat similar results in certain cases, it does not match the specific changes required by the criterion. The criterion is asking for direct preservation of names during the assignment and mapping of breaks, rather than conditionally setting labels after the fact.\n\nThe submission doesn't implement the two specific code changes that were identified in the criterion, which appear necessary to properly preserve the names of discrete breaks.\n\nGRADE: I"

Added a condition in the `init` method to check if labels are a waiver and breaks have names, and if so, use the names as labels.\n2. Added similar logic in the `break_info` method specifically for discrete scales, to ensure named breaks are properly used for labels.\n\nThese changes ensure that when breaks have names, those names will be used as labels by default (when labels are set to waiver), which aligns with the expected behavior for discrete scales."

          "explanation": "I need to assess if the submission matches the criterion, which suggests two specific changes to ensure that when discrete breaks have names, they'll be used as labels by default.\n\nThe criterion suggests these specific changes:\n1. Change `self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()` to `self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())`\n2. Change `breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)` to `breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))`\n\nThe submission's approach is different. Instead of preserving break names during assignment and mapping, it adds a new conditional block to the `init` function:\n```r\nif (is.waiver(self$labels) && scale$is_discrete() && !is.null(names(self$breaks))) {\n  self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n}\n```\n\nWhile the submission attempts to solve the same problem (using names of discrete breaks as labels), it doesn't match the specific changes requested in the criterion. The criterion focuses on preserving names during breaks assignment and mapping operations, while the submission focuses on explicitly setting labels based on break names.\n\nThe approach in the submission might work in some cases, but it doesn't ensure that break names are consistently preserved throughout the code as the criterion's approach would.\n\nGRADE: I",

          "explanation": "I need to assess if the submission meets the criterion for making discrete breaks' names be used as labels by default in ggplot2's secondary axes.\n\nThe criterion specifies two specific changes that need to be made:\n\n1. In the `init` function, change `self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()` to `self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())` to ensure names are preserved.\n\n2. In the `break_info` function, change `breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)` to `breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))` to ensure names are properly passed along during mapping.\n\nThe submission takes a different approach by modifying the `init` function with conditional logic to check for named breaks and assign them to labels. While this might help in some cases, it doesn't address the fundamental issue that the names of breaks need to be preserved throughout the processing pipeline.\n\nThe submission's approach doesn't implement either of the two specific changes required by the criterion. The solution in the criterion is more direct - it ensures that names are preserved when getting breaks and when mapping them, rather than trying to handle names separately in the labeling logic.\n\nGRADE: I",

Let me suggest edits to address this issue:\n\n```diff\n  init = function(self, scale) {\n    if (self$empty()) {\n      return()\n    }\n    transform <- self$trans\n    if (!is.function(transform)) {\n      cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n    }\n    if (is.derived(self$name) && !is.waiver(scale$name)) self$name <- scale$name\n    if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n    if (is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n      } else {\n        breaks <- scale$get_transformation()$breaks\n        n_breaks <- scale$n.breaks\n        if (!is.null(n_breaks) && \"n\" %in% fn_fmls_names(breaks)) {\n          self$breaks <- function(x) breaks(x, n = n_breaks)\n        } else {\n          self$breaks <- breaks\n        }\n      }\n    }\n-   if (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n+   if (is.derived(self$labels)) {\n+     if (scale$is_discrete() && !is.null(names(self$breaks)) && \n+         length(names(self$breaks)) == length(self$breaks)) {\n+       self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n+     } else {\n+       self$labels <- scale$labels\n+     }\n+   } else if (is.waiver(self$labels) && scale$is_discrete() && \n+              !is.null(names(self$breaks)) && length(names(self$breaks)) == length(self$breaks)) {\n+     self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n+   }\n    if (is.derived(self$guide)) self$guide <- scale$guide\n  },\n```\n\nThis change makes two important adjustments:\n\n1. When labels are derived from the primary axis, we check if we're dealing with a discrete scale and if the breaks have names. If so, we use those names as labels.\n\n2. Similarly, when labels are set to the default `waiver()`, we also check for named breaks and use them if available.\n\nThe modifications ensure that when discrete breaks have names, those names will be used as labels by default for the secondary axis, maintaining consistency with how primary axes handle named breaks in ggplot2.\n***\n[Criterion]: ```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n      } \n```\n\n...should be changed to:\n\n```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())\n      } \n```\n\nand, later, on:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)\n    }\n```\n\ncan be changed to:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))\n    }\n```\n\nThat's all that's needed, but both changes are needed.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

In the `init` function, change `self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()` to `self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())` to ensure names are preserved.\n\n2. In the `break_info` function, change `breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)` to `breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))` to ensure names are properly passed along during mapping.\n\nThe submission takes a different approach by modifying the `init` function with conditional logic to check for named breaks and assign them to labels. While this might help in some cases, it doesn't address the fundamental issue that the names of breaks need to be preserved throughout the processing pipeline.\n\nThe submission's approach doesn't implement either of the two specific changes required by the criterion. The solution in the criterion is more direct - it ensures that names are preserved when getting breaks and when mapping them, rather than trying to handle names separately in the labeling logic.\n\nGRADE: I"

When labels are derived from the primary axis, we check if we're dealing with a discrete scale and if the breaks have names. If so, we use those names as labels.\n\n2. Similarly, when labels are set to the default `waiver()`, we also check for named breaks and use them if available.\n\nThe modifications ensure that when discrete breaks have names, those names will be used as labels by default for the secondary axis, maintaining consistency with how primary axes handle named breaks in ggplot2."

Modified the `create_scale` method to accept a `labels` parameter and pass it to the temporary scale.\n\n2. Added logic in the `break_info` method to detect when we have discrete scales with named breaks, and use those names as labels when no explicit labels are provided (and when labels are set to the default `waiver()`).\n\n3. Updated the call to `create_scale` to pass the potentially modified labels.\n\nThis should ensure that when discrete breaks have names, those names will be used as the default labels for the secondary axis, consistent with how primary axes behave."

Modified the `create_scale` method to accept a `labels` parameter and pass it to the temporary scale.\n\n2. Added logic in the `break_info` method to detect when we have discrete scales with named breaks, and use those names as labels when no explicit labels are provided (and when labels are set to the default `waiver()`).\n\n3. Updated the call to `create_scale` to pass the potentially modified labels.\n\nThis should ensure that when discrete breaks have names, those names will be used as the default labels for the secondary axis, consistent with how primary axes behave.\n***\n[Criterion]: ```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n      } \n```\n\n...should be changed to:\n\n```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())\n      } \n```\n\nand, later, on:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)\n    }\n```\n\ncan be changed to:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))\n    }\n```\n\nThat's all that's needed, but both changes are needed.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Usually this is [guide_axis()].\n#'\n#' @details\n#' `sec_axis()` is used to create the specifications for a secondary axis.\n#' Except for the `trans` argument any of the arguments can be set to\n#' `derive()` which would result in the secondary axis inheriting the\n#' settings from the primary axis.\n#'\n#' `dup_axis()` is provide as a shorthand for creating a secondary axis that\n#' is a duplication of the primary axis, effectively mirroring the primary axis.\n#'\n#' As of v3.1, date and datetime scales have limited secondary axis capabilities.\n#' Unlike other continuous scales, secondary axis transformations for date and datetime scales\n#' must respect their primary POSIX data structure.\n#' This means they may only be transformed via addition or subtraction, e.g.\n#' `~ . + hms::hms(days = 8)`, or\n#' `~ . - 8*60*60`. Nonlinear transformations will return an error.\n#' To produce a time-since-event secondary axis in this context, users\n#' may consider adapting secondary axis labels.\n#'\n#' @examples\n#' p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(cyl, mpg)) +\n#'   geom_point()\n#'\n#' #

Modified the `create_scale` method to accept a `labels` parameter and pass it to the temporary scale.\n\n2. Added logic in the `break_info` method to detect when we have discrete scales with named breaks, and use those names as labels when no explicit labels are provided (and when labels are set to the default `waiver()`).\n\n3. Updated the call to `create_scale` to pass the potentially modified labels.\n\nThis should ensure that when discrete breaks have names, those names will be used as the default labels for the secondary axis, consistent with how primary axes behave."

Updated the call to `create_scale` to pass the potentially modified labels.\n\nThis should ensure that when discrete breaks have names, those names will be used as the default labels for the secondary axis, consistent with how primary axes behave."

Modified the `create_scale` method to accept a `labels` parameter and pass it to the temporary scale.\n\n2. Added logic in the `break_info` method to detect when we have discrete scales with named breaks, and use those names as labels when no explicit labels are provided (and when labels are set to the default `waiver()`).\n\n3. Updated the call to `create_scale` to pass the potentially modified labels.\n\nThis should ensure that when discrete breaks have names, those names will be used as the default labels for the secondary axis, consistent with how primary axes behave."

All secondary\n#' axes must be based on a one-to-one transformation of the primary axes.\n#'\n#' @param transform A formula or function of a strictly monotonic transformation\n#'\n#' @param trans `r lifecycle::badge(\"deprecated\")`\n#'\n#' @param name The name of the secondary axis\n#'\n#' @param breaks One of:\n#'   - `NULL` for no breaks\n#'   - `waiver()` for the default breaks computed by the transformation object\n#'   - A numeric vector of positions\n#'   - A function that takes the limits as input and returns breaks as output\n#'\n#' @param labels One of:\n#'   - `NULL` for no labels\n#'   - `waiver()` for the default labels computed by the transformation object\n#'   - A character vector giving labels (must be same length as `breaks`)\n#'   - A function that takes the breaks as input and returns labels as output\n#'\n#' @param guide A position guide that will be used to render\n#'   the axis on the plot. Usually this is [guide_axis()].\n#'\n#' @details\n#' `sec_axis()` is used to create the specifications for a secondary axis.\n#' Except for the `trans` argument any of the arguments can be set to\n#' `derive()` which would result in the secondary axis inheriting the\n#' settings from the primary axis.\n#'\n#' `dup_axis()` is provide as a shorthand for creating a secondary axis that\n#' is a duplication of the primary axis, effectively mirroring the primary axis.\n#'\n#' As of v3.1, date and datetime scales have limited secondary axis capabilities.\n#' Unlike other continuous scales, secondary axis transformations for date and datetime scales\n#' must respect their primary POSIX data structure.\n#' This means they may only be transformed via addition or subtraction, e.g.\n#' `~ . + hms::hms(days = 8)`, or\n#' `~ . - 8*60*60`. Nonlinear transformations will return an error.\n#' To produce a time-since-event secondary axis in this context, users\n#' may consider adapting secondary axis labels.\n#'\n#' @examples\n#' p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(cyl, mpg)) +\n#'   geom_point()\n#'\n#' #

          "explanation": "I need to evaluate whether the submission meets the criterion for allowing named discrete breaks to be used as labels by default.\n\nThe criterion suggests two specific changes:\n\n1. In the `init` function, change \n   ```\n   if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n     self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n   }\n   ```\n   to\n   ```\n   if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n     self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. In the `break_info` function, change\n   ```\n   else {\n     breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)\n   }\n   ```\n   to\n   ```\n   else {\n     breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))\n   }\n   ```\n\nThe submission does not make either of these changes. Instead, it proposes adding a conditional check in the `init` function that would set `self$labels` based on the names of `self$breaks` if certain conditions are met. \n\nWhile the submission is attempting to address the issue of using named breaks as labels, it doesn't implement the specific solution required by the criterion. The criterion specifies that the names of the breaks should be preserved during mapping operations, which the submission doesn't address.\n\nThe submission's approach might work in some cases, but it doesn't follow the specific implementation requested in the criterion.\n\nGRADE: I",

The criterion specifies that the names of the breaks should be preserved during mapping operations, which the submission doesn't address.\n\nThe submission's approach might work in some cases, but it doesn't follow the specific implementation requested in the criterion.\n\nGRADE: I"

          "explanation": "I need to assess whether the submitted solution correctly follows the criterion for finding the tailnum with the highest proportion of NA arr_delays among planes with at least 100 flights.\n\nThe criterion specifies three main steps:\n1. First filter grouped data to only keep rows for tailnums with >100 flights\n2. Then summarize to calculate proportion of NA arr_delays using mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n3. Arrange in descending order by that proportion\n\nLooking at the submitted solution:\n```r\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    total_flights = n(),\n    na_delays = sum(is.na(arr_delay)),\n    na_proportion = na_delays / total_flights\n  ) %>%\n  filter(total_flights >= 100) %>%\n  arrange(desc(na_proportion)) %>%\n  slice(1) %>%\n  pull(tailnum)\n```\n\nThe solution has a critical sequencing issue. It first summarizes ALL tailnums (calculating total_flights, na_delays, and proportion) and then filters for those with at least 100 flights. The criterion specifies filtering first, then summarizing.\n\nThe approach uses `sum(is.na(arr_delay))/total_flights` which is equivalent to `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` but less concise.\n\nAdditionally, the solution includes extra steps (`slice(1)` and `pull(tailnum)`) that weren't specified in the criterion, though these are reasonable additions.\n\nThe solution doesn't follow the correct workflow order as specified in the criterion - it summarizes first and then filters, rather than filtering first and then summarizing.\n\nGRADE: P",

Group the flights by `tailnum`\n2. Count the total flights and the number of NA `arr_delay` values for each plane\n3. Calculate the proportion of NA values\n4. Filter for planes with at least 100 flights\n5. Find the plane with the highest proportion of NA values\n\nHere's the code:\n\n```r\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    total_flights = n(),\n    na_delays = sum(is.na(arr_delay)),\n    na_proportion = na_delays / total_flights\n  ) %>%\n  filter(total_flights >= 100) %>%\n  arrange(desc(na_proportion)) %>%\n  slice(1) %>%\n  pull(tailnum)\n```\n\nThis code:\n- Groups flights by tail number\n- Calculates total flights and counts NA values in arr_delay\n- Computes the proportion of flights with missing arrival delay\n- Filters to include only planes with at least 100 flights\n- Sorts in descending order by the NA proportion\n- Takes the first row (highest proportion)\n- Returns just the tail number value\n\nThe result will be the tail number of the plane with the highest proportion of missing arrival delay values among planes that have flown at least 100 flights.\n***\n[Criterion]: There are three main steps here:\n\n1) A grouped filter: only keep rows in `flights` that have > 100 rows. Notably, no persistent summarization across rows should happen here. \n2) A grouped summarize: taking `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` will determine the proportion of NA `arr_delay`s. Notably, `mean(arr_delay == \"NA\")` or `mean(arr_delay == NA)` is not correct.\n3) Arrange by the resulting column in descending order.\n\nThe `planes` data is irrelevant and should be ignored.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  filter(n() > 100, .by = tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay)), \n    .by = tailnum\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nWith the old `group_by()` syntax:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nThe `ungroup()` and `group_by()` in the middle can be omitted, since the same grouping variable is used for both:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nSome `tailnum`s are NA, but there's not enough context in the question to determine that; correct answers can include a line along the lines of `filter(!is.na(tailnum))`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

First filter grouped data to only keep rows for tailnums with >100 flights\n2. Then summarize to calculate proportion of NA arr_delays using mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n3. Arrange in descending order by that proportion\n\nLooking at the submitted solution:\n```r\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    total_flights = n(),\n    na_delays = sum(is.na(arr_delay)),\n    na_proportion = na_delays / total_flights\n  ) %>%\n  filter(total_flights >= 100) %>%\n  arrange(desc(na_proportion)) %>%\n  slice(1) %>%\n  pull(tailnum)\n```\n\nThe solution has a critical sequencing issue. It first summarizes ALL tailnums (calculating total_flights, na_delays, and proportion) and then filters for those with at least 100 flights. The criterion specifies filtering first, then summarizing.\n\nThe approach uses `sum(is.na(arr_delay))/total_flights` which is equivalent to `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` but less concise.\n\nAdditionally, the solution includes extra steps (`slice(1)` and `pull(tailnum)`) that weren't specified in the criterion, though these are reasonable additions.\n\nThe solution doesn't follow the correct workflow order as specified in the criterion - it summarizes first and then filters, rather than filtering first and then summarizing.\n\nGRADE: P"

          "explanation": "I'll evaluate the submitted answer against the criterion.\n\nThe submission uses a different approach than the one described in the criterion. Let's analyze it step by step:\n\n1. The criterion calls for first filtering tailnums with more than 100 flights, then summarizing. The submission instead does this in one summarize step, calculating total_flights = n() and then filtering afterward (filter(total_flights >= 100)).\n\n2. The calculation of the proportion of NA values is correct: the submission uses mean(is.na(arr_delay)), which matches the criterion.\n\n3. The submission arranges in descending order of the NA proportion, which matches the criterion.\n\n4. The submission adds an extra step (pull(tailnum)) to extract just the tailnum value, which isn't explicitly required but doesn't detract from the solution.\n\nWhile the approach is different, the submission's logic is sound. However, it doesn't follow the specific sequence of operations outlined in the criterion:\n- It doesn't use a grouped filter to keep rows that have > 100 flights\n- It calculates the count in a summarize step rather than using n() in a filter\n\nThe submission uses a valid alternative approach that would return the correct result, but it doesn't match the specified methodology in the criterion.\n\nGRADE: P",

Groups the flights data by tailnum\n2. For each tailnum, calculates the total number of flights and the proportion of flights with NA arr_delay values\n3. Filters to keep only tailnums with at least 100 flights\n4. Sorts by the proportion of NAs in descending order\n5. Takes the first row (the tailnum with the highest proportion of NAs)\n6. Extracts just the tailnum value\n\nThis will give you the tailnum with the highest proportion of missing arrival delay values among planes that have flown at least 100 times.\n***\n[Criterion]: There are three main steps here:\n\n1) A grouped filter: only keep rows in `flights` that have > 100 rows. Notably, no persistent summarization across rows should happen here. \n2) A grouped summarize: taking `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` will determine the proportion of NA `arr_delay`s. Notably, `mean(arr_delay == \"NA\")` or `mean(arr_delay == NA)` is not correct.\n3) Arrange by the resulting column in descending order.\n\nThe `planes` data is irrelevant and should be ignored.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  filter(n() > 100, .by = tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay)), \n    .by = tailnum\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nWith the old `group_by()` syntax:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nThe `ungroup()` and `group_by()` in the middle can be omitted, since the same grouping variable is used for both:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nSome `tailnum`s are NA, but there's not enough context in the question to determine that; correct answers can include a line along the lines of `filter(!is.na(tailnum))`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Let's analyze it step by step:\n\n1. The criterion calls for first filtering tailnums with more than 100 flights, then summarizing. The submission instead does this in one summarize step, calculating total_flights = n() and then filtering afterward (filter(total_flights >= 100)).\n\n2. The calculation of the proportion of NA values is correct: the submission uses mean(is.na(arr_delay)), which matches the criterion.\n\n3. The submission arranges in descending order of the NA proportion, which matches the criterion.\n\n4. The submission adds an extra step (pull(tailnum)) to extract just the tailnum value, which isn't explicitly required but doesn't detract from the solution.\n\nWhile the approach is different, the submission's logic is sound. However, it doesn't follow the specific sequence of operations outlined in the criterion:\n- It doesn't use a grouped filter to keep rows that have > 100 flights\n- It calculates the count in a summarize step rather than using n() in a filter\n\nThe submission uses a valid alternative approach that would return the correct result, but it doesn't match the specified methodology in the criterion.\n\nGRADE: P"

A grouped filter to keep only `tailnum`s with > 100 flights\n2. A grouped summarize using `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` to calculate proportion of NA values\n3. Arrange in descending order of this proportion\n\nLooking at the submission:\n\n```r\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    total_flights = n(),\n    na_arr_delays = sum(is.na(arr_delay)),\n    prop_na = na_arr_delays / total_flights\n  ) %>%\n  filter(total_flights >= 100) %>%\n  arrange(desc(prop_na)) %>%\n  slice(1) %>%\n  select(tailnum, prop_na, total_flights)\n```\n\nThe submission takes a different approach:\n- It first summarizes to get the count of total flights and NA values\n- It then filters for `tailnum`s with at least 100 flights\n- It calculates the proportion using division rather than `mean(is.na(arr_delay))`\n\nWhile this approach will produce the correct result (the tailnum with highest proportion of NA arr_delays), it doesn't follow the specific method required in the criterion. The criterion specifically requires filtering before summarizing, and using `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` directly.\n\nAdditionally, the criterion mentions that the `planes` data is irrelevant, which the submission correctly ignored.\n\nGRADE: P",

Then, for each `tailnum`, I'll calculate the proportion of flights where `arr_delay` is NA. Finally, I'll find the `tailnum` with the highest proportion.\n\nHere's the code:\n\n```r\nflights %>%\n  # Count flights and NA arr_delays by tailnum\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    total_flights = n(),\n    na_arr_delays = sum(is.na(arr_delay)),\n    prop_na = na_arr_delays / total_flights\n  ) %>%\n  # Filter for tailnums with at least 100 flights\n  filter(total_flights >= 100) %>%\n  # Sort by proportion of NA arr_delays (highest first)\n  arrange(desc(prop_na)) %>%\n  # Get the tailnum with highest proportion\n  slice(1) %>%\n  select(tailnum, prop_na, total_flights)\n```\n\nThis code:\n1. Groups the flights by `tailnum`\n2. Calculates the total number of flights and the number of flights with NA `arr_delay` values\n3. Computes the proportion of flights with NA `arr_delay`\n4. Filters to include only those with at least 100 flights\n5. Sorts in descending order by the proportion of NA values\n6. Takes the first row (highest proportion)\n7. Returns the `tailnum` along with its proportion of NA values and total flight count\n***\n[Criterion]: There are three main steps here:\n\n1) A grouped filter: only keep rows in `flights` that have > 100 rows. Notably, no persistent summarization across rows should happen here. \n2) A grouped summarize: taking `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` will determine the proportion of NA `arr_delay`s. Notably, `mean(arr_delay == \"NA\")` or `mean(arr_delay == NA)` is not correct.\n3) Arrange by the resulting column in descending order.\n\nThe `planes` data is irrelevant and should be ignored.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  filter(n() > 100, .by = tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay)), \n    .by = tailnum\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nWith the old `group_by()` syntax:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nThe `ungroup()` and `group_by()` in the middle can be omitted, since the same grouping variable is used for both:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nSome `tailnum`s are NA, but there's not enough context in the question to determine that; correct answers can include a line along the lines of `filter(!is.na(tailnum))`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

The criterion specifically requires filtering before summarizing, and using `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` directly.\n\nAdditionally, the criterion mentions that the `planes` data is irrelevant, which the submission correctly ignored.\n\nGRADE: P"

Finally, I'll find the `tailnum` with the highest proportion.\n\nHere's the code:\n\n```r\nflights %>%\n  # Count flights and NA arr_delays by tailnum\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    total_flights = n(),\n    na_arr_delays = sum(is.na(arr_delay)),\n    prop_na = na_arr_delays / total_flights\n  ) %>%\n  # Filter for tailnums with at least 100 flights\n  filter(total_flights >= 100) %>%\n  # Sort by proportion of NA arr_delays (highest first)\n  arrange(desc(prop_na)) %>%\n  # Get the tailnum with highest proportion\n  slice(1) %>%\n  select(tailnum, prop_na, total_flights)\n```\n\nThis code:\n1. Groups the flights by `tailnum`\n2. Calculates the total number of flights and the number of flights with NA `arr_delay` values\n3. Computes the proportion of flights with NA `arr_delay`\n4. Filters to include only those with at least 100 flights\n5. Sorts in descending order by the proportion of NA values\n6. Takes the first row (highest proportion)\n7. Returns the `tailnum` along with its proportion of NA values and total flight count"

Adds a `name` argument that defaults to `deparse(substitute(dataset))` to extract the name of the dataset object from the calling environment\n2. Sets the `name` attribute with `attr(res, \"name\") <- name`\n3. Preserves the rest of the function without adding comments to existing code\n\nHowever, the submission is missing one critical element from the criterion:\n- It does not include `force(name)` before `check_dataset(dataset)`, which is needed to ensure the substitution works correctly. This is important because the value of `substitute(dataset)` needs to be captured immediately in the calling environment.\n\nThe order of setting attributes is also slightly different from the criterion (name is set after dir in the submission, but before dir in the criterion), but this is a minor issue that wouldn't affect functionality.\n\nThe main problem is the missing `force(name)` call, which is explicitly mentioned in the criterion as necessary.\n\nGRADE: P"

Therefore, it's giving you the deparsed representation of the tibble itself, not the variable name.\n\n## Solution\n\nYou need to capture the argument name *before* it gets evaluated. Here are two approaches:\n\n### Option 1: Using rlang's quosure system\n\n```r\ntask_create <- function(\n    dataset,\n    name = NULL,\n    dir = eval_log_dir()\n) {\n  # Capture the expression used for 'dataset'\n  dataset_expr <- rlang::enquo(dataset)\n  \n  # Use the expression as default name if name is NULL\n  if (is.null(name)) {\n    # Try to get a clean name from the expression\n    name <- rlang::quo_name(dataset_expr)\n    # If it's still too complex, use a generic name\n    if (nchar(name) > 100) {\n      name <- \"dataset\"\n    }\n  }\n  \n  # Rest of your function...\n}\n```\n\n### Option 2: Simpler approach with default arguments\n\n```r\ntask_create <- function(\n    dataset,\n    name = NULL,\n    dir = eval_log_dir()\n) {\n  # If name is NULL, try to get the calling argument's name\n  if (is.null(name)) {\n    call <- match.call()\n    if (!is.null(call$dataset)) {\n      name <- deparse(call$dataset)\n      # Ensure name isn't too complex\n      if (nchar(name) > 100) {\n        name <- \"dataset\"\n      }\n    } else {\n      name <- \"dataset\"\n    }\n  }\n  \n  # Rest of your function...\n}\n```\n\nBoth of these approaches will correctly capture the variable name used for the `dataset` argument when the function is called, giving you \"simple_addition\" in your example.\n\nThe second approach is simpler but might not handle all edge cases as robustly as the rlang approach.\n***\n[Criterion]: The `name` default is evaluated lazily, and something else results in `dataset` being evaluated before `name` is. `name` must be evaluated early in the function, e.g. using `force(name)`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

The submission also correctly fixes the outerServer function by properly namespacing the inner module IDs (`ns(\"inner1\")` etc.).\n\nThe submission precisely addresses the main issue identified in the criterion - replacing `NS(id)` with `session$ns` - which ensures that dynamically generated UI elements have fully-qualified namespaces that match their corresponding server outputs.\n\nGRADE: C"

If there's a mismatch there, it would cause this kind of error.\n\n## Related Considerations\n\n- Package names in R should only contain letters, numbers, and dots (not hyphens), which might explain why the GitHub repo name differs from the R package name\n- Make sure you're using the latest version of pkgdown and its GitHub Actions workflow\n\nThis appears to be a configuration issue rather than a user error - you're attempting to do things the right way, but the tools need a bit more explicit guidance to connect the repository to the package name.\n***\n[Criterion]: The user needs to specify the package name explicitly in the Remotes `DESCRIPTION` field using a `<package>=` prefix, e.g. `spatialstuff=org/spatial-Stuff`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

This is exactly what the criterion specifies - using the `<package>=` prefix to link the package name with the GitHub repository.\n\nThe submission correctly identifies the core issue (the disconnect between the package name and repository location) and provides the proper syntax to resolve it.

The issue is that there's a mismatch between how `pak` (the package installer used by GitHub Actions) is interpreting your dependency information.\n\n## The Problem\n\nWhen you have:\n```\nImports:\n  spatialstuff\nRemotes:\n  org/spatial-Stuff\n```\n\nThe package system is looking for a package named `spatialstuff` (lowercase, no hyphens), but the remote repository is named `spatial-Stuff` (with hyphen, mixed case).\n\n## Solution\n\nYou need to explicitly tell the package system that the package name `spatialstuff` corresponds to the GitHub repository `org/spatial-Stuff`. The correct format is:\n\n```\nImports:\n  spatialstuff\nRemotes:\n  org/spatial-Stuff@*release\n```\n\nOr, for more clarity, you can use the explicit GitHub remote specification:\n\n```\nRemotes:\n  github::org/spatial-Stuff\n```\n\nIf the package name inside the repository differs from the repository name, you should be even more explicit:\n\n```\nRemotes:\n  spatialstuff=github::org/spatial-Stuff\n```\n\nThis tells the package system that the package named `spatialstuff` should be installed from the GitHub repository `org/spatial-Stuff`.\n\n## Additional Troubleshooting\n\nIf that doesn't work, you might need to check:\n\n1. That the package in the repository actually declares itself as `spatialstuff` in its DESCRIPTION file\n2. That the repository is public or your GitHub Action has appropriate access\n3. That the package is in the root of the repository, not in a subdirectory\n\nThe explicit mapping approach should solve the issue by making the connection between package name and repository location clear to the package management system.\n***\n[Criterion]: The user needs to specify the package name explicitly in the Remotes `DESCRIPTION` field using a `<package>=` prefix, e.g. `spatialstuff=org/spatial-Stuff`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

The issue is with recursive evaluation of the default argument `chat = chat` in your nested function.\n\nHere's how to fix it:\n\n```r\ngenerate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  \n  function(input, chat_arg = NULL) {\n    # Use the outer function's chat if chat_arg is NULL\n    ch <- if(is.null(chat_arg)) chat$clone() else chat_arg$clone()\n    res <- ch$chat(input)\n    list(result = res, chat = ch)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe problem with your original code is that when R evaluates `function(input, chat = chat)`, it's trying to use the parameter name `chat` as both the default value and the parameter name, which creates a recursive reference.\n\nBy using a different parameter name (`chat_arg`) and handling the default case explicitly inside the function, you avoid the recursive reference while maintaining the same functionality.\n\nAlternatively, you could do this:\n\n```r\ngenerate <- function(default_chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  \n  function(input, chat = default_chat) {\n    ch <- chat$clone()\n    res <- ch$chat(input)\n    list(result = res, chat = ch)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nHere, the variable name in the outer function is different from the parameter name in the inner function, which also avoids the recursive reference.\n***\n[Criterion]: It can be fixed by changing the name of the `chat` argument in one of the functions or assigning the `chat` object in the outer function to a different variable name internally and then supplying that renamed object as the default to the inner function.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Assigning the `chat` object in the outer function to a different variable name internally and using that renamed variable as the default in the inner function.\n\nThe submission provides two solutions that both correctly address the issue:\n\n1. The first solution changes the parameter name in the inner function from `chat` to `chat_arg` and handles the default logic inside the function body.\n\n2. The second solution renames the parameter in the outer function to `default_chat` while keeping the inner function parameter as `chat`.\n\nBoth approaches correctly resolve the recursive reference problem by ensuring the inner function's parameter doesn't have the same name as the variable it's trying to reference from the outer scope.\n\nThese solutions directly align with the criterion - they either change the argument name in one of the functions or use a different variable name in the outer function to avoid the recursive reference.\n\nGRADE: C"

Here are a few ways to fix it:\n\n### Option 1: Different parameter name in inner function\n\n```r\ngenerate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  \n  function(input, chat_obj = chat) {\n    ch <- chat_obj$clone()\n    res <- ch$chat(input)\n    list(result = res, chat = ch)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nBy using a different parameter name (`chat_obj`) in the inner function, you avoid the recursive reference.\n\n### Option 2: Use NULL as default and handle it inside the function\n\n```r\ngenerate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  \n  function(input, chat_obj = NULL) {\n    # Use the outer chat if chat_obj is NULL\n    ch <- if(is.null(chat_obj)) chat$clone() else chat_obj$clone()\n    res <- ch$chat(input)\n    list(result = res, chat = ch)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Option 3: Force evaluation of the outer chat\n\n```r\ngenerate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  chat_instance <- chat  # Force evaluation\n  \n  function(input, chat_obj = chat_instance) {\n    ch <- chat_obj$clone()\n    res <- ch$chat(input)\n    list(result = res, chat = ch)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAny of these approaches should resolve the recursive reference issue you're encountering.",

Uses `cli::cli_abort()` instead of `rlang::abort()`\n2. Eliminates all `paste0()` calls\n3. Uses the `{?}` pluralization syntax to handle different cases\n4. Uses the `.val` formatter to display and properly format the values\n\nThe submission's pluralization handling is almost exactly like the example in the criterion, with some minor differences:\n- Uses `{?s}` for pluralizing \"argument\" (correct)\n- Uses `{?is/are}` for verb agreement (correct)\n- Uses `{?a}` instead of `{a/some}` as in the criterion\n- Does not include `{?/an}` before \"argument\"\n\nWhile there are slight differences in the pluralization approach compared to the criterion example, the submission successfully implements the pluralization requirements using the `{?}` syntax and produces functionally equivalent output. The solution is correct in terms of the core requirements.\n\nGRADE: C"

Correctly moves the `output$plot` definition with its full `renderPlot()` code inside the server function\n2. Properly structures the server function as a standalone function that's passed to `shinyApp()`\n3. Reorganizes the reactive expressions to be within the server function\n4. Correctly simplifies the reactives by using `input$condition` and `input$visit_threshold` directly\n\nThe submitted solution matches the essential structure shown in the criterion. It places the rendering logic in the proper place - inside the server function. The solution also recognizes that the original reactive expressions could be simplified (removing the separate reactive wrappers for condition and threshold).\n\nThe solution completely addresses the problem described in the criterion and would fix the error in the Shiny app.\n\nGRADE: C",

Additionally, you're just referencing `output$plot` inside your server function instead of including the full definition.\n\n## Corrected Code\n\n```r\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\n# Load & Rename data \nKidney_Correlations_Data <- read_excel(\"Kidney Correlations Data.xlsx\")\nKidney_Correlations_Data <- as.data.frame(Kidney_Correlations_Data) %>%\n  mutate(\n    CKD_STAGE = str_replace(Kidney_Correlations_Data[[3]], \"CKD 3.*\", \"CKD 3\")\n  )\n\n# Create a dropdown menu for the user to select the CKD condition level\n# and a numeric input field for the visit threshold\nui <- fluidPage(\n  sidebarLayout(\n    sidebarPanel(\n      selectInput(\"condition\", \"Select CKD Condition:\", c(\"CKD 3\", \"CKD 4\", \"CKD 5\", \"ESRD\")),\n      numericInput(\"visit_threshold\", \"Minimum Visit Count:\", value = 5, min = 0)\n    ),\n    mainPanel(\n      plotOutput(\"plot\")\n    )\n  )\n)\n\n# Server logic\nserver <- function(input, output) {\n  # Create a reactive function to filter the data based on user input\n  filtered_data <- reactive({\n    Kidney_Correlations_Data %>% \n      filter(CKD_STAGE == input$condition, VISIT_COUNT > input$visit_threshold)\n  })\n  \n  # Create a linear model and visualization\n  output$plot <- renderPlot({\n    validate(\n      need(input$condition != \"\", \"Please select a condition\"),\n      need(input$visit_threshold > 0, \"Please enter a valid visit threshold\")\n    )\n    \n    # Filter the data based on the user's input\n    data <- filtered_data()\n    \n    # Create a linear model\n    lm_model <- lm(Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED ~ VISIT_COUNT, data = data)\n    \n    # Create a plot of the linear model\n    ggplot(data, aes(x = VISIT_COUNT, y = Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED)) + \n      geom_point() + \n      geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) + \n      labs(x = \"Visit Count\", y = \"Paid Amount\")\n  })\n}\n\n# Run the application\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n```\n\n## Key Changes Made:\n\n1. Moved all reactive expressions and outputs INSIDE the server function\n2. Removed the separate `ckd_condition` and `visit_threshold` reactive expressions since you can directly use `input$condition` and `input$visit_threshold`\n3. Fixed the structure of the server function - it should be defined separately and passed to shinyApp()\n4. Removed the incorrect `output$plot` reference inside the server function - the proper output definition is now included in the server\n\nThese changes should resolve your error. The fundamental issue was that your reactive logic was defined outside the server function, but Shiny expects all reactivity to be defined within the server context.\n***\n[Criterion]: There's a `output$plot` alone in the anonymous server function. The solution is to move the `output$plot` and rendering code into a proper server function, like:\n\n```\n# ...same ui\n\nserver <- function(input, output) {\n  # Create reactive functions to filter the data based on user input\n  filtered_data <- reactive({\n    Kidney_Correlations_Data %>% \n      filter(CKD_STAGE == input$condition, VISIT_COUNT > input$visit_threshold)\n  })\n  \n  # Create a linear model and visualization\n  output$plot <- renderPlot({\n    validate(\n      need(input$condition != \"\", \"Please select a condition\"),\n      need(input$visit_threshold > 0, \"Please enter a valid visit threshold\")\n    )\n                                   # Filter the data based on the user's input\n    data <- filtered_data()\n    \n                                   # Create a linear model\n    lm_model <- lm(Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED ~ VISIT_COUNT, data = data)\n    \n                                   # Create a plot of the linear model\n    ggplot(data, aes(x = VISIT_COUNT, y = Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED)) + \n      geom_point() + \n      geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) + \n      labs(x = \"Visit Count\", y = \"Paid Amount\")\n  })\n}\n\n# Run the application\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n```\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Correctly moves the `output$plot` definition with its full `renderPlot()` code inside the server function\n2. Properly structures the server function as a standalone function that's passed to `shinyApp()`\n3. Reorganizes the reactive expressions to be within the server function\n4. Correctly simplifies the reactives by using `input$condition` and `input$visit_threshold` directly\n\nThe submitted solution matches the essential structure shown in the criterion. It places the rendering logic in the proper place - inside the server function. The solution also recognizes that the original reactive expressions could be simplified (removing the separate reactive wrappers for condition and threshold).\n\nThe solution completely addresses the problem described in the criterion and would fix the error in the Shiny app.\n\nGRADE: C"

          "explanation": "I need to assess whether the submission correctly identifies and fixes the issue with the Shiny app according to the criterion.\n\nThe criterion identifies that the key problem is the incomplete server function that just has `output$plot` in it without actually defining what that output should be. The correct solution involves moving the output definition and reactive expressions inside a proper server function.\n\nThe submission correctly:\n1. Identifies the core issue: \"the server function is incomplete\" and \"you've defined the outputs outside the server function\"\n2. Provides a solution that moves all the reactive expressions and output definitions inside the server function\n3. Properly structures the server function to include the plot rendering code\n4. Shows how to correctly pass the server function to shinyApp()\n\nThe submission actually goes beyond the minimum required fix by also:\n- Moving the data loading into the server function (which is a good practice)\n- Simplifying the reactive expressions by removing the separate ones for condition and threshold\n- Adding a session parameter to the server function\n\nThese additional changes are beneficial but not strictly required to fix the immediate error. The core fix matches what's described in the criterion - moving the output definition into a proper server function.\n\nGRADE: C",

Identifies the core issue: \"the server function is incomplete\" and \"you've defined the outputs outside the server function\"\n2.

Shows how to correctly pass the server function to shinyApp()\n\nThe submission actually goes beyond the minimum required fix by also:\n- Moving the data loading into the server function (which is a good practice)\n- Simplifying the reactive expressions by removing the separate ones for condition and threshold\n- Adding a session parameter to the server function\n\nThese additional changes are beneficial but not strictly required to fix the immediate error. The core fix matches what's described in the criterion - moving the output definition into a proper server function.\n\nGRADE: C"

Because of that, this line in `token_refresh() `now results in a warning (which really should be an error):\n\n```\nout$refresh_token <- out$refresh_token %||% refresh_token\n# Warning message:\n# In out$refresh_token :\n#  partial match of 'refresh_token' to 'refresh_token_expires_in'\n```\n\nSince out has `refresh_token_expires_in` (and not `refresh_token`), adding `refresh_token` doesn't work as expected.\n\n<\/issue>\n\nAvoid partial matching of `refresh_token` in this function:\n\n```r\ntoken_refresh <- function(client, refresh_token, scope = NULL, token_params = list()) {\n  out <- oauth_client_get_token(\n    client,\n    grant_type = \"refresh_token\",\n    refresh_token = refresh_token,\n    scope = scope,\n    !!!token_params\n  )\n  out$refresh_token <- out$refresh_token %||% refresh_token\n  out\n}\n```\n***\n[Submission]: The issue is that R's behavior for accessing list elements with `$` includes partial matching, which means that if a list has a field named `refresh_token_expires_in` but not `refresh_token`, then `out$refresh_token` will return the value of `refresh_token_expires_in` with a warning instead of returning NULL.\n\nHere's the fixed version of the function that avoids partial matching:\n\n```r\ntoken_refresh <- function(client, refresh_token, scope = NULL, token_params = list()) {\n  out <- oauth_client_get_token(\n    client,\n    grant_type = \"refresh_token\",\n    refresh_token = refresh_token,\n    scope = scope,\n    !!!token_params\n  )\n  # Use `[[` instead of `$` to avoid partial matching\n  out$refresh_token <- out[[\"refresh_token\"]] %||% refresh_token\n  out\n}\n```\n\nBy using `[[` instead of `$`, we ensure exact matching so that only a field exactly named `refresh_token` will be accessed. This prevents the unintended partial match with `refresh_token_expires_in`.\n***\n[Criterion]: Change `out$refresh_token <- out$refresh_token %||% refresh_token` to `out[[\"refresh_token\"]] <- out[[\"refresh_token\"]] %||% refresh_token`.

However, instead of making the simple, direct replacement specified in the criterion, the submission:\n\n1. Completely rewrote the assignment logic using an if-else structure\n2. Added extra code with explicit checks\n3. Made the solution more verbose than what was requested\n\nThe criterion was very specific - only change the single line to use double bracket notation instead of the dollar sign notation, without any other changes to the function. The submission went well beyond this requirement with a more complex implementation.\n\nWhile the submission's solution would work correctly to solve the underlying issue, it does not meet the specific, minimal change requested in the criterion.\n\nGRADE: I"

Here's how to do it:\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\npipe %>%\n  mutate(result = stringr::str_replace(appointment_key, \"\\\\|\\\\|\", \"T\") %>%\n           stringr::str_replace(\"\\\\|\\\\|\", \"A\"))\n```\n\n## Explanation:\n\n1. `stringr::str_replace()` replaces only the first occurrence of the pattern\n2. The first call replaces the first `||` with \"T\"\n3. The second call replaces the second `||` with \"A\"\n4. We need to escape the pipe characters with double backslashes (`\\\\|\\\\|`) because `|` is a special character in regex\n\n## Alternative Approach:\n\nIf you want more control or have a varying number of pipes to replace with different characters, you could use a more general approach:\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\npipe %>%\n  mutate(result = appointment_key %>%\n           stringr::str_replace_all(\"\\\\|\\\\|\", function(x) {\n             replacements <- c(\"T\", \"A\")\n             static_counter <- 0\n             stringr::str_replace_all(x, \"\\\\|\\\\|\", function(y) {\n               static_counter <<- static_counter + 1\n               replacements[min(static_counter, length(replacements))]\n             })\n           }))\n```\n\nBoth methods will produce the result you're looking for with \"T\" and \"A\" replacing the pipe characters."

Here's how to do it:\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\npipe %>%\n  mutate(result = stringr::str_replace(appointment_key, \"\\\\|\\\\|\", \"T\") %>%\n           stringr::str_replace(\"\\\\|\\\\|\", \"A\"))\n```\n\n## Explanation:\n\n1. `stringr::str_replace()` replaces only the first occurrence of the pattern\n2. The first call replaces the first `||` with \"T\"\n3. The second call replaces the second `||` with \"A\"\n4. We need to escape the pipe characters with double backslashes (`\\\\|\\\\|`) because `|` is a special character in regex\n\n## Alternative Approach:\n\nIf you want more control or have a varying number of pipes to replace with different characters, you could use a more general approach:\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\npipe %>%\n  mutate(result = appointment_key %>%\n           stringr::str_replace_all(\"\\\\|\\\\|\", function(x) {\n             replacements <- c(\"T\", \"A\")\n             static_counter <- 0\n             stringr::str_replace_all(x, \"\\\\|\\\\|\", function(y) {\n               static_counter <<- static_counter + 1\n               replacements[min(static_counter, length(replacements))]\n             })\n           }))\n```\n\nBoth methods will produce the result you're looking for with \"T\" and \"A\" replacing the pipe characters."

It:\n- Correctly calls `str_replace()` twice in sequence\n- First replaces \"||\" with \"T\", then replaces the next \"||\" with \"A\"\n- Uses proper escaping of the pipe characters\n- Creates a new column rather than modifying the existing column (which was noted as acceptable in the criterion)\n\nThe only minor differences from the criterion example are:\n- Creating a new column called `transformed` rather than overwriting `appointment_key` or using `result`\n- Using the pipe operator (`%>%`) for chaining instead of separate function calls\n- Not implementing the optional equivalence test\n\nThese differences don't affect the core functionality of the solution, and the criterion specifically mentioned that assigning to a new column is acceptable.\n\nGRADE: C",

It takes the `appointment_key` column\n2. Replaces the first occurrence of `||` with \"T\"\n3. Replaces the second occurrence of `||` with \"A\"\n\nThis works because `str_replace()` only replaces the first match it finds, so the sequential calls to `str_replace()` handle each pair of pipes in order.\n***\n[Criterion]: Call `str_replace()` twice, once for the first pair of pipes and once for the second:\n\n```\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# replace pipes\npipe <- pipe |> \n  mutate(\n    # first instance of ||\n    appointment_key = str_replace(\n      string = appointment_key,\n      pattern = '\\\\|\\\\|',\n      replacement = 'T'\n    ),\n    # second instance of ||\n    appointment_key = str_replace(\n      string = appointment_key,\n      pattern = '\\\\|\\\\|',\n      replacement = 'A'\n    ),\n    # optional: test for equivalence\n    equivalent = appointment_key == result\n  )\n```\n\nNotably, `str_replace()` should be called twice, in order. The solution should not use `str_replace_all()`. Using `||` for the `pattern` is fine as long as `fixed = TRUE`. A correct solution can either assign to `appointment_key` or `result`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

A more reliable approach would be:\n\n```r\npipe %>%\n  mutate(result = appointment_key %>%\n           str_replace(\"\\\\|\\\\|\", \"T\") %>%\n           str_replace(\"\\\\|\\\\|\", \"A\"))\n```\n\nThis sequentially replaces the first occurrence of `||` with \"T\", and then replaces the next occurrence with \"A\".\n\nThe `\\\\|\\\\|` double backslashes are needed because the pipe character `|` is a special character in regular expressions, so it needs to be escaped.\n***\n[Criterion]: Call `str_replace()` twice, once for the first pair of pipes and once for the second:\n\n```\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# replace pipes\npipe <- pipe |> \n  mutate(\n    # first instance of ||\n    appointment_key = str_replace(\n      string = appointment_key,\n      pattern = '\\\\|\\\\|',\n      replacement = 'T'\n    ),\n    # second instance of ||\n    appointment_key = str_replace(\n      string = appointment_key,\n      pattern = '\\\\|\\\\|',\n      replacement = 'A'\n    ),\n    # optional: test for equivalence\n    equivalent = appointment_key == result\n  )\n```\n\nNotably, `str_replace()` should be called twice, in order. The solution should not use `str_replace_all()`. Using `||` for the `pattern` is fine as long as `fixed = TRUE`. A correct solution can either assign to `appointment_key` or `result`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Using `str_replace()` twice instead of `str_replace_all()`\n2. Replacing the first occurrence with 'T' and the second with 'A'\n3. Applying the replacements in the correct order\n\nThe submission differs slightly from the criterion solution in that:\n- It creates a new column `result` rather than modifying `appointment_key`\n- It uses the pipe operator `%>%` instead of `|>`\n- It doesn't include the optional equivalence test\n\nHowever, these differences are acceptable according to the criterion, which states: \"A correct solution can either assign to `appointment_key` or `result`.\"\n\nThe submission also properly explains the need to escape the pipe character in the regex pattern.\n\nGRADE: C"

Replaced `expect_warning()` with `expect_snapshot()`\n2. Added `error = TRUE` parameter to indicate we're expecting an error/warning\n3.

This is an internal function that dplyr uses but doesn't make available for direct use by other packages.\n\n## Options to fix this:\n\n### 1. Add dplyr to Imports and use `:::`\n\nYou can access non-exported functions using the triple colon operator:\n\n```r\ndplyr:::closest()\n```\n\nHowever, this is **not recommended** and will likely cause CRAN check warnings/errors because:\n- Using `:::` is discouraged in packages\n- Relying on non-exported functions creates a fragile dependency that could break with any dplyr update\n\n### 2. Copy the implementation (best option)\n\nThe proper way to handle this is to copy the implementation into your own package:\n\n```r\n# In your R file\nclosest <- function(x, y) {\n  # Copy the implementation from dplyr\n  # Ensure you comply with license requirements\n  # Add proper attribution\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Use alternative exported functions\n\nIf possible, find alternative exported functions that provide similar functionality.\n\n### 4. Contact dplyr maintainers\n\nYou could request the function be exported in future versions of dplyr.\n\n## Recommendation\n\nThe second option (copying the implementation) is typically the best approach for internal functions you need to use. Make sure to properly attribute the source and check the license compatibility."

Here's what's happening and how to fix it:\n\n## What's Happening\n\nThe `closest()` function is likely an internal function in dplyr that's not meant to be called directly by users. When functions aren't exported from a package's namespace, they're considered internal implementation details.\n\n## Solutions\n\nYou have a few options:\n\n### 1. Use the proper exported alternative\n\nCheck if there's an exported function in dplyr that provides the same functionality. Look at the dplyr documentation to find the appropriate function.\n\n### 2. Import the function correctly\n\nIf you absolutely need to use this internal function, you can use the `:::`  operator to access non-exported functions:\n\n```r\ndplyr:::closest()\n```\n\nBut this is **not recommended** because:\n- Internal functions can change without notice\n- It creates a dependency on undocumented behavior\n- It will likely cause CRAN check warnings/errors\n\n### 3. Copy the function into your package\n\nIf you need this functionality, you could copy the implementation into your own package:\n\n```r\n# In your own package\nclosest <- function(...) {\n  # Copy of dplyr's internal implementation\n}\n```\n\nMake sure to document where the function came from and that you have the appropriate license to do this.\n\n### 4. Use a different approach\n\nThe best solution is usually to use exported functions that accomplish the same task, or implement the functionality yourself in a way that doesn't rely on non-exported functions.\n\n## CRAN Notes\n\nUsing internal functions from other packages will likely cause CRAN check issues. CRAN explicitly discourages using `:::` to access non-exported functions because they're considered implementation details that may change.\n\nThe fact that it works in your package suggests you might be importing it somehow or there might be a different package exporting a function with that name that's being loaded.\n***\n[Criterion]: The user just needs to add `utils::globalVariables(\"closest\")` somewhere in their package and remove the explicit namespacing; `closest()` isn't exported from dplyr but dplyr will use non-standard evaluation on the expression and handle it correctly.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Using a proper exported alternative\n2. Using the `:::` operator to access non-exported functions\n3. Copying the function into the user's package\n4. Using a different approach altogether\n\nHowever, the submission does not mention the specific solution stated in the criterion: adding `utils::globalVariables(\"closest\")` to the package and removing the explicit namespacing. This is actually the cleanest solution for this particular case, as it would:\n- Tell R not to warn about an undefined variable\n- Allow dplyr's non-standard evaluation to handle the function correctly\n- Prevent CRAN check issues\n\nThe submission does recognize that there's an issue with a non-exported function and that accessing it with `:::` is problematic, which is partially correct. However, it misses the main solution that would solve the problem most effectively according to the criterion.\n\nGRADE: I"
