\usage{
inspect_bind(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{\code{Task} objects to combine, optionally named.}
}
\value{
A tibble with the combined samples from all tasks, with a \code{task}
column indicating the source and a nested \code{metadata} column containing
additional fields
}
\description{
Combine multiple \code{Task} objects into a single tibble for comparison.

This function takes multiple (optionally named) \code{Task} objects and row-binds
their samples together, adding a \code{task} column to identify the source of each
row. The resulting tibble nests additional columns into a \code{metadata} column
and is ready for further analysis.
